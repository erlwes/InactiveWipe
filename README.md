### 游리 I found guest that can be wiped, now what?
If you are not familiar with PowerShell to perform batch operations like remove and disable/block of users in Entra ID, you can use bulk operations in the Entra AD portal.

1. Use the tool to identify and select users for removal (UPN copied to clipboard when clicking ok from gridview)
2. Go to User blade in Entra AD portal
3. Select "Bulk operations" and "Bulk delete"
4. Download example CSV
5. Open the example CSV, paste guest-users UPN, save the file
6. Upload the file to "bulk delete users" and type "Yes" to contine.
7. Click "Submit"
